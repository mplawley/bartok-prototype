# installation and play

Open Unity and start Scene 0. Match suit or number of the target card--draw from the draw pile if you can't! The first player out of the 4 (3 being non-human) to get rid of all the cards in her hand wins!

# motivation

I am going through Jeremy Gibson's <i>Game Design, Prototyping, and Development</i> textbook and building the prototypes he gives the reader to do. This is the fifth prototype.
